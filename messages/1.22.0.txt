Compare Side-by-Side 1.22.0
---------------------------

I got to notice that the plugin did old tricks with the installed color schemes.
These were not elegant nor fail-proof.  And now they're gone.

This means the colors you see the next time are different from what you're
used to see.  But hey, we now use the standard colors from Sublime Text for
diffs.

Hence, you can change the colors in your color scheme (ctrl+shift+P,
"UI: Customize Color Scheme") as it should be and not in the settings of
this plugin anymore.

The following scopes/colors are used:

`diff.inserted.sbs-compare`, `diff.inserted.char.sbs-compare`,
`diff.deleted.sbs-compare`, `diff.deleted.char.sbs-compare`.

Note that I added the suffix ".sbs-compare".  That means that you can either
change the scope e.g. `diff.inserted` to affect all diff views in Sublime Text
or target `diff.inserted.sbs-compare` specifically to only select "our" views.
