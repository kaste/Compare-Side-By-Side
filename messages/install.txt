Compare Side-by-Side
--------------------

ðŸ‘‹

This package adds a simple side-by-side comparison tool to Sublime Text.

Usage Options
---

  - Right click on a tab or within a buffer and select "Compare with..."
    This will open up a panel listing all other open views.  Choose one
    of them as the target (or "B" part) to compare with.

    Alternatively, right click on a *tab* and select "Compare with active tab"

  - You can also compare arbitrary selections.
    Just highlight some text, right click -> "Mark selection for comparison".
    Now, mark a second selection, then right click -> "Compare selections".

    Alternatively, create two selections using the multi-cursor feature of Sublime
    and then "Compare selections" directly.

  - This plugin can be used from the command line.
    See https://github.com/kaste/Compare-Side-By-Side/blob/master/README_COMMANDS.md

  - In the comparison view you can jump from modification to modifictaion:
    `alt+n` (as in: `n`ext) jumps forwards and `alt+p` (`p`revious) backwards.
